    <h2>
      Your Risk Score
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your risk score is derived from the results of the questionnaire you just completed. The questionnaire was built from applying behavioural psychology principles to the measurement of risk attitudes in personal investing. These principles demonstrate that there is more than one way to understand what risk means to you.  As a result, we have taken a multi-factor approach that integrates with your specific financial situation to build a more comprehensive and personal risk score.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The theory
    </h2>
    <p>
      Investment theory relies heavily on the concept of the trade-off between risk and reward: the higher the expected return, the riskier the investment. This concept makes intuitive sense since it applies to so much else in life: if I drive faster down the road, I get to my destination faster, but at an increased chance of having an accident (or getting a ticket).
      <br/><br/>
      From our review of behavioural psychology and its lessons for investors, we knew that most investors do not have a strictly linear relationship in their assessments of risk and return. The research suggests that they generally hate losses about twice as much as they like gains. This preference makes them more likely to take risks to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.
      <br/><br/>
      Other research has demonstrated that people suffer from other biases as well, like the recency bias (recent events tend to weigh more heavily in decision making than potentially more relevant events further in the past) and the framing bias (decisions are made relative to a piece of information that is provided). In addition, it is reasonably clear that investors don’t look at their net worth as a whole, but instead have “wallets” to help them in achieving particular goals. Investors may, moreover, have different comfort levels with assuming the risk of missing a goal for each wallet; they may be willing to accept retiring later, but they must have the money available when a child is starting university.
      <br/><br/>
      As a result, we determined that that there are five aspects of risk that need to be understood in order to better understand an individual’s risk profile. These aspects are:
    </p>
    <h2>
      Risk Aspect
    </h2>
      <p><b>Capacity</b>: The ability of a client to experience losses without dire consequences</p>
      <p><b>Tolerance</b>: The emotional comfort with experience of losses</p>
      <p><b>Perception</b>: The client’s experience with investing </p>
      <p><b>Knowledge/Experience</b>: The ability of a client to experience losses without dire consequences</p>
      <p><b>Required</b>: The risk that needs to be incurred to achieve the returns necessary to achieve goals</p>
      <p>Each question in the questionnaire is applied to at least one of these risk aspects. </p>
    <h2>
      The score
    </h2>
    <p>
      We think that a risk tolerance score should measure the point at which one begins to feel queasy looking at a portfolio statement with losses. Yet risk tolerance scores have typically been determined through answers to a short list of questions that cover most of the risk aspects above, but then aggregate the answers to create a score that is argued to be a measure of your risk tolerance. The standard questions also don’t taken into account an individual’s specific situation.
      <br/><br/>
      We also considered whether each of the risk aspects were equally important in understanding your risk profile. We don’t think so. Knowledge and experience may make you more comfortable with risk, but if you don’t have sufficient investments to absorb losses and continue to pay your mortgage, this comfort level is irrelevant.
      <br/><br/>
      In the end, we think that risk capacity and risk tolerance are the most important aspects in assessing your risk profile. So we derive our risk score primarily from the results of the questions related to these risk aspects. The results of the other three aspects have a small impact, but the score is driven by the intersection of your ability to absorb losses (risk capacity) and your aversion to actual losses (risk tolerance).
    </p>
    <h2>
      …and It Works
    </h2>
    <p>
      Interestingly, we included a self-assessment question on risk tolerance at the end of the questionnaire. It is there in order to help us validate the risk tolerance score we achieve from the other questions. So far, we have found that there is a strong agreement between our score and the answer provided by takers of the questionnaire.
